# Notifier for Xcode
So, you download Xcode from the App Store, you're working on your app without issues, and one day App Store auto-updates Xcode and you can no longer compile your app. Has that happened to you? Is this for reason that a lot of developers prefer to download from the Apple Developers site directly. Now, this has a disadvantage: you won't know when a new version is available. Notifier for Xcode comes to solve this.
