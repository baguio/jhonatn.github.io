# Jhona.tn home
Now based in Swift's 'Publish

# Build
A simple `swift run` is enough, but you can also use Publish's CLI (`publish run`) for some extra development features

# Development
To have the development of this project available at any time, it has been configured to work with Replit, which includes having a `replit.nix` and limiting Swift's features to what Replit has available.
Also, to use Publish with a model that fits better product pages, a fork of it is being used with page metadata support. A pull request is active at the moment to merge this feature into the main branch.

# Deployment
A site like this can be deployed as a Github Page entirely for free, but because of other additional features, like lambdas and redirections, it is being deployed on Netlify and includes a `netlify.toml` configuration file
